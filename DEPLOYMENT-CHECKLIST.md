# ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Checklist

## Files Ready for Docker Deployment

### Required Files in `crawl4ai-server/` directory:
- ‚úÖ `Dockerfile` - Complete Docker setup with Playwright
- ‚úÖ `requirements.txt` - All Python dependencies including playwright
- ‚úÖ `main.py` - FastAPI app with runtime Playwright verification
- ‚úÖ `install_playwright.py` - Playwright installation helper
- ‚úÖ `.env` - Local environment template
- ‚úÖ `README.md` - Documentation

### Key Configuration Points:

**Dockerfile highlights:**
```dockerfile
# Install system dependencies for Playwright
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y [browser dependencies]

# Install Python dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Install Playwright browsers
RUN python -m playwright install chromium
RUN python -m playwright install-deps chromium

# Verify installation
RUN python -c "from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright; ..."
```

**Requirements.txt includes:**
- `fastapi`
- `uvicorn[standard]`
- `crawl4ai==0.6.3`
- `groq`
- `playwright` ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical for browser support**

## üöÄ Ready to Deploy

Your files are properly configured for Docker deployment on Render!

**Next steps:**
1. Commit and push to GitHub
2. Follow the RENDER-DOCKER-GUIDE.md
3. Set Environment to **Docker** (not Python)
4. Set Root Directory to **crawl4ai-server**
5. Add your GROQ_API_KEY

**The Docker approach will handle:**
- ‚úÖ System dependencies installation
- ‚úÖ Playwright browser installation
- ‚úÖ Browser verification
- ‚úÖ Proper environment setup

No more "executable doesn't exist" errors! üéâ
