# fix-deployment.md - Quick Fix Instructions

## 🚨 Issue Identified: Playwright Browsers Not Installed

Your Crawl4AI server is running but failing because Playwright browsers aren't installed on Render.

### Error Details:
```
BrowserType.launch: Executable doesn't exist at /opt/render/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium-1179/chrome-linux/chrome
```

## ✅ Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Files Already Updated
I've updated these files in your project:
- ✅ `crawl4ai-server/requirements.txt` - Added Playwright
- ✅ `crawl4ai-server/render.yaml` - Added browser installation commands
- ✅ `crawl4ai-server/Dockerfile` - Alternative Docker deployment

### Step 2: Commit and Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Add Playwright browser installation for Render deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Redeploy on Render
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find your `snuffl-crawl4ai-server` service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
4. **Wait 5-10 minutes** (browser installation takes time)

### Step 4: Monitor Build Logs
Watch for these success messages:
- ✅ `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
- ✅ `playwright install chromium`
- ✅ `playwright install-deps chromium`

### Step 5: Test After Deployment
Run this test to verify the fix:
```bash
node test-crawl4ai-endpoint.js
```

## 🔄 Alternative: Docker Deployment

If the Python deployment still fails:

1. **Change Environment to Docker**:
   - In Render dashboard → Service Settings
   - Change "Environment" from "Python" to "Docker"
   - Set "Dockerfile Path" to `Dockerfile`

2. **Redeploy**:
   - The Docker build handles Playwright installation automatically

## 📊 Expected Results After Fix

Your test should show:
- ✅ Health check: `{ status: 'healthy' }`
- ✅ Simple scrape: `{ success: true }`
- ✅ Product scrape: `{ success: true, productName: 'actual product name' }`
- ✅ Integration: `scrapedProducts` array with product data

## 🕐 Timeline
- **Build time**: 5-10 minutes (due to browser installation)
- **First run**: May be slower as browsers initialize
- **Subsequent runs**: Normal speed

The fix is ready - just commit, push, and redeploy! 🚀
